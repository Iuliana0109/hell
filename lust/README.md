# Lust
<blockquote> <i>
<i> Thus I descended out of the first circle <br>
Down to the second, that less space begirds,<br>
And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.<br>
<br> 
There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls; <br>
Examines the transgressions at the entrance;<br>
Judges, and sends according as he girds him</i></blockquote>
