<blockquote> <i>
I SAY, continuing, that long before <br>
We to the foot of that high tower had come,<br>
Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,<br>
By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there, <br>
And from afar another answer them,<br>
So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.</i></blockquote>
