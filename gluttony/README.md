# Gluttony
<blockquote> <i>
<i>At the return of consciousness, that closed <br>
Before the pity of those two relations, <br>
Which utterly with sadness had confused me, <br>
New torments I behold, and new tormented <br>
Around me, whichsoever way I move, <br>
And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.</i>

## Idea

I've decided to simulate a haunted house. <br>
The story is about a person (the user) that decides to explore the house. They don't know in witch room the ghost is but if they encounter it, the ghost is gonna kill them.
<br> <br>
The idea was inspired mostly by Miss Havisham - a secondary character in the "Great Expectations" by Charles Dickens and I got a little bit inspired by Edgar ALlan Poe so credits to those two incredible authors.

## Casses
