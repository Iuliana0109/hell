# Limbo
<blockquote> <i>
Broke the deep lethargy within my head <br>
A heavy thunder, so that I started, <br>
Like to a person who by force is wakened; 
<br><br>
And round about I moved my rested eyes, <br>
Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed, <br>
To recognise the place wherein I was.</i></blockquote>
