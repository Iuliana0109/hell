<blockquote> <i>
“PAPE Satan, Pape Sat ` an, Aleppe!” <br>
Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began; <br>
And that benignant Sage, who all things knew, <br><br>
Said, to encourage me: “Let not thy fear<br>
Harm thee; for any power that he may have<br>
Shall not prevent thy going down this crag”</i></blockquote>
